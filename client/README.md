## Setting Up Environment Variables for the Frontend

Before you start working on the frontend side of the project, it's crucial to set up your environment variables correctly. These variables are used to configure the backend URL that your frontend application will communicate with. Below are the steps to set up the necessary values in your local environment.

### Step 1: Obtain Backend URL

1. Ensure that your backend server is running and accessible. If you're running the backend locally, it should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if you've configured it differently).

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

1. Open the `.env.example` file in the `client/` directory of your project.
2. Locate the `VITE_REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` variable.
3. Replace the placeholder value with the actual URL of your backend server. For local development, this would typically be `http://localhost:3000`.
4. Save the file as `.env` in the same directory.

### Step 3: Verify Your Setup

1. Start the frontend development server by running `npm run dev` in the `client/` directory.
2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).
3. Ensure that there are no errors related to missing environment variables and that your application can successfully communicate with the backend.

By following these steps, you should have successfully set up your environment variables for the frontend side of the project. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the project's README.md for further assistance.

Note: The `.env` file should not be committed to your version control system. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being tracked by Git.
